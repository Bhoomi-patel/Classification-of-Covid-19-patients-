# Classification-of-Covid-19-patients

We do the classification of the covid-19 patients into positive or negative using the chest X-rays images. Dataset is available in Kaggle. We use Deep Learning and Machine 
Learning approaches. We use the Histogram of the chest X-ray images for classification and our own CNN model.
